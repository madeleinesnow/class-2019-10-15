```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)

library(tidyverse)
library(janitor)
library(fs)
library(gt)

```

```{r tibble, include=TRUE}

bowls <- tibble(replicate = 1:10000) %>% 
       mutate(which_bowl = sample(c("Bowl 1", "Bowl 2"), size = 10000, replace = TRUE)) %>% 
       mutate(cookie = ifelse(which_bowl == "Bowl 1", 
          sample(c("vanilla", "chocolate"), size = 10000, replace = TRUE, prob = c(0.75, 0.25)),
          sample(c("vanilla", "chocolate"), size = 10000, replace = TRUE, prob = c(0.5, 0.5))))
       
```

If you pick a vanilla cookie, what is the probability that it is from bowl 1 or bowl 2?

```{r vanilla, include=TRUE}

bowls %>% 
  tabyl(which_bowl, cookie) %>% 
  adorn_percentages(denominator = "col") %>% 
  adorn_pct_formatting() %>% 
  gt()

```
